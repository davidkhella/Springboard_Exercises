// What Iâ€™ve learned so far:
// JavaScript:
// How to loop through an array:
const array = ['string', 'string2']
for (let index in array) {
    return index;
}

//Function with arguments:
function myFunction(a,b) {
    return a + b;
}

//Callback functions:
function myFunction1(){
    console.log('I am: myFunction1');
}

function myFunction2(a){
    if (a >= 1) {
        myFunction1();
    }
}

//functions in Classes are known as methods

//jQuery
//library must be installed in the html file
$('button').on('click', functionName);

//Populating the UI with api data
async function apiFunction(){
    const response = await axios.get('URL');
    const someData = response.data.somedata;
    const $heading = $('#heading');

    return $heading.append(`${someData}`);

}

//GET means retrieve data to display
//POST means change data at the endpoint
//token is a unique identifier for a user
//always ask what is a functions input and expected output

//Python

- Be intentional about learning
- Capstones can be based on existing apps but identifies and solves a problem that was not solved before so it stands out and is not an exact replica
- Learn the technical skills but the problem solving skills are more important
- I am learning the alphabet but cannot create sentense yet
- Interviews are looking for mental readiness, exceptional problem solving engineers
