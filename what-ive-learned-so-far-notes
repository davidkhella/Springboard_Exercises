// What Iâ€™ve learned so far:
// JavaScript:
// How to loop through an array:
const array = ['string', 'string2']
for (let index in array) {
    return index;
}

//Function with arguments:
function myFunction(a,b) {
    return a + b;
}

//Callback functions:
function myFunction1(){
    console.log('I am: myFunction1');
}

function myFunction2(a){
    if (a >= 1) {
        myFunction1();
    }
}

//functions in Classes are known as methods

//jQuery
//library must be installed in the html file
$('button').on('click', functionName);

//Populating the UI with api data
async function apiFunction(){
    const response = await axios.get('URL');
    const someData = response.data.somedata;
    const $heading = $('#heading');

    return $heading.append(`${someData}`);

}

/* API notes:
GET means retrieve data to display
POST means change data at the endpoint
token is a unique identifier for a user
always ask what is a functions input and expected output
*/

/*Python
x = 'a variable'

for str in x:
    print(str)

this is a list = ['string', 'string2']
this is a dictionary = {'key': 'value'}
this is a tuple = (val1, val2)
there are built in functions like len() to identify the length of data type
there are built in methods like slicing lst[start:stop:step], simple slicing lst[2:] removes first 2 indices 

venv virtual environment to install python packages and not weigh down git repo
clone git project, activate venv, install packages from requirements.txt
open files with open("morse.txt", "r") also:
"file = open("filename.txt")

for line in file:
    print("LINE IS...", line)
file.seek(0)
all_text = file.read()
file.close()"

/*Post coding skills skills:
- Be intentional about learning
- Capstones can be based on existing apps but identifies and solves a problem that was not solved before so it stands out and is not an exact replica
- Learn the technical skills but the problem solving skills are more important
- I am learning the alphabet but cannot create sentense yet
- Interviews are looking for mental readiness, exceptional problem solving engineers

/* Git Hub
initialize git repo with git init

use these commands to update files in git repo:
    - git add . // stages all files that have changed
    - git commit // checks in all changes
    - git push // pushes changes to git repo
